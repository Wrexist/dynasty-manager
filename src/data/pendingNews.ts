/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Dynasty Manager — Pending "What's New" bullets (next, unshipped version)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Bullets accumulate here during development of the *next* version. When
 * `package.json.version` advances past the top entry of `whatsNew.ts`,
 * `scripts/seal-whats-new.mjs` folds these bullets into a fresh top entry on
 * `whatsNew.ts` and resets this file back to empty arrays.
 *
 * Authoring paths:
 *   • Manual:  npm run whats-new -- improved "Match engine runs 30% faster."
 *   • Auto:    .github/workflows/append-pending-news.yml runs on PR merge,
 *              parses the PR's `## What's New` body section (or PR title) and
 *              appends to the right category here, then commits back.
 *
 * Headline / summary are optional manual overrides. When `null`, the seal
 * script auto-generates them from the lead bullets (same logic that was in
 * the old `build-whats-new.mjs`).
 *
 * This file is the source of truth for bullets that have not yet been sealed
 * into a shipped release. It is NOT imported by app code — only by the
 * release-notes tooling. Keep its shape narrow and its parser-friendly.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
